I thought blogging was a diary. 

A technical imprint of time, so that I could look back and remember what I did or thought at a certain time of my life. 

It started out that way. 

A record of events. 

This happened. That happened. I was here. I thought something. I did something next. 

But it always felt dry and dutiful that way. Over time I learned that bloggign for me was reliving a moment in time, when I felt a certain way, exposed to some corner of life that was hidden from most. 

A moist dark damp stuffy corner of life that even the person living it never knew about. 

People being treated for traumatic injuries that landed them in a coma, that forced their family to confront whether or not the patient practiced their religion as they had hoped, or whther it was in fact OK for us to treat their crtitical blood loss with transfusions because they were nto a practicing Jehovah's Witness even though you wanted them to be. 

That their dog's name was Crystal and you used it for your family passward to get updates in the ICU, but you didn't know that the dogs middle name was Meth. 

We did. We knew all the types of secrets that get exposed when youre loved one is brought in unconscious, naked having been stripped of his clothes by the flight crew looking for critical injuries to stabilize, secrets revelealed in blood alcohol levels, drug tests and friends who were with him and survived the accient and what the police had uncovered. 

But we couldn't tell you any of that.  

All we could do was help you be present with your son, who was dying, but whose ife you saved by admitting that he didn't share the same beliefs as you, Whose dog Crystal Meth was wagging her tail waiting for him to come home, and the love you had for your son allowed you to give us permission to give him blood so his heart could deliver the oxygen his brain needed to heal. 

When we heard him say "Thank you" one morning we were in tears just like you were an hour later when viisitng hours opened. 

"Thank God" you prayed, your hands clasped in front of you, your eyes to the cieling, looking through the florescent lights and steel to the heavens above, your arthritic knees screaming when you dropped to your knees and the nurses helped you to a seat so you could continine thanking the God that both of you shared, just in different ways. 

I learned that blogging was about communicating these precious, secret moments that few had the privieldge to not only witness but be an integral part of. 

And this was just one perspective as a single intern in the ICU in September on call every 3rd night. What stories were missed and not recorded by others still keeps me awake at night. Nights I are warm, safe and tucked into my cozy bed, decades away from those long sleepless nights in the ICU as a 34 year old new graduate. 

Soon I'll be retiring, still thanking my own God that Crystal Meth was what united you and your family in communicating with the medical staff, and saved your son's life. 

Sometimes I wonder if he ever started wearing a seatbelt.
