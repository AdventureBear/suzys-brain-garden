Medical school, week 1 

Designed to inspire and excite. Each day that week is a 50 minute interactive lecture series titled, "Life without a ...",   The two I remember are legs and heart.   A patient with prosthetic limbs on both legs walked out on stage, stood and faced us, placed his hands behind is back and smiled.   A patient with a heart transplant tells us how she warms up for a run to increase blood flow to her legs, since the nerves that excite the heart and increase the heart rate were severed during the surgery. 

We meet physicians in various stages of their career.  One who had to retire from neurosurgery due to rheumatoid arthritis in his hands.  One who was sued after a teenage patient he saw died. 

We are given a book, "On Doctoring" full of essays by physicians about what its like to be a physician.  I still have my copy...but havn't read all the stories in it.  In fact i think i've only read one. 

We hear from 2nd, 3rd and 4th year medical students who tell us about what its like on the wards, to put all the medical knowledge to use and interact with patients as soon as...next week! 

On one hand, the level of support and encouragement is unmatched by anything I've done before. Everyone wants us to succeed and thrive!  

Yet at the same time there was something more...a chain of command, a ladder of seniority.  When you're a second year, you can look forward to (you'll be allowed to...) do this.  When you're a 3rd year you get to (you're allowed to...) do that. 

The students in each year ahead of us were eager to share their experience and tips and help us keep making forward progress. 

But there was a feeling emerging that I wasn't expecting.   After taking 36 credits of science after already having completed a bachelor's of science degree with a minor in German, after finding volunteer opportunities to expose myself to the world of doctoring that felt enriching to me and not just a rite of passage to add to my application to medical school.  After a full 2 years of waiting after taking the MCATs, applying to schools, interviews and finally accepting my position in the class of 2002 at the University of Pittsburgh, I was not prepared for this one thing. 

Through all that preparation, I was in kind of a 'top dog' position.  Big fish in a little pond.  Great grades, greater ambition and outstanding MCAT scores.  An easygoing interviewer that put fellow interviewees slightly off, because I wasn't beign formal enough. I was taking this process too casually, yet coming out of faculty interviews with a smile on my face.   

I was 5 years older than other people in the same stage of applying to medical school.  But when you're 27, those 5 years are a lifetime of experience.  I had worked several jobs in the meantime...retail, outward bound instructor, database analyst and programmer, math tutor, science tutor...the kinds of jobs that teach you a lot about interacting with people of all ages, problem solving, guiding people on wilderness expeditions, not only teachign skills to stay warm and dry, paddle a canoe and cook over a fire, but also teaching people how to develop resiliency, set goals, face fears and overcome challenges. 

After all that time, growth, life-experience and success in going back to school taking my GPA from a 2.89 in undergrad to a 4.0 in my post-bacc (cumulative 3.01), I was not prepared to face this heirarchy.  

"You're a first year student," we were told.   Compared to the rest of them, we required not only knowledge but also hand-holding, permission, restrictions, limited-opportunities for enrichment activities (only so many students can fit in an OR at once!)...

It was a strange combination of being in charge of our own success, while having the heirarchy of medicine constantly impressed upon us, as if we were plucked flowers being pressed in a book...the weight of more experienced students, residents and physicians, holding us down under that first year weight of a stack of syllabi  and hours of lecture...

I don't know.  Learnign medicine is one of the biggest privledges of my life.  The tiered medical education system works. 

I took my first major exam in medical school on my 30th birthday. By the time I was working on the floors i was 32 and being told how to behave and how to do my work by people who had gone straight through medical school & residency without ever having worked a job, taught a teenqger how to portage a canoe, helped a breast cancer survivor find the internal strength to try climbing a rock face, helping a vietnam veteran trust in a stranger...or be a trusted stranger...while climbing a 30 foot rock face for the first time. 

Medicine is definately a priveledge. But styding medicine doesn't teach you how to work with people the same way that a service type job does. People think im ridiculus when I say thta being a doctor is a lot like selling outdoors equipment or working in a bike shop.    

Learning what their needs are, diagnosing the problem and offering solutions based on deep knowledge...it's the same whether you're selling $150 hiking boots to a thru-hiker, coaching a terrifed adult to jump off the final platform on a high-ropes course, or helping a patient with trouble breathing feel better. 

I think the lack of recognition for my life experience prior to startign school was off-putting during those first days and weeks of school.   The heirarchy built into the system is part of what helps people grow as a physician...both helping new doctors learn the skills without causing patient harm, as well as helping the senior student/resident/fellow learn how to teach and guide "younger" (ie lower on the ladder) than they are. 

But you now what, it never stops.   After graduating medical school you're notes are signed with your years out of school, designated as "R" (resident) or "PG" (post-graduate) followed by the number of years since your graduation. (Interns are R1 or PG-1 or even PGY-1, fellows are PGY-5 or 6, etc).   By the time you finish and become an attending it is dropped all-together and you just become an unadorned MD on signed notes.  The lack of the PGY or R experience after your signature indicates that you've compelted the gauntlet of education and training. 

But the learning never stops, hopefully. 

Signed, 
Me, MD, PGY-24
