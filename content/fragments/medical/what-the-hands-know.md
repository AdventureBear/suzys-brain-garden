One of the most sacred parts of training to become a physician is learning how to perform procedures on people.   Whether minor, cosmetic, diagnostic or life-saving, it is a huge privilege to be trusted and trained to do so.


One procedure stands out where it goes most smoothly when 'slightly' rushed.   By slightly rushed, I don't mean sloppy.  I mean a sequence of physical steps combined with a rapid visual and intuitive assessment of what's happening inside the patient's body during the process.


We first learn by studying the components and tools that will be used during the procedure, usually a sterile, but opened unused kit, set out specifically for physicians to hold, handle, explore and play with to become accustomed to holding them, manipulating them and the sequence of how to use them.




Take a central line for example.   There are several steps that must happen in order.


After determining that a central line is needed, the patient is prepped, and you are scrubbed and dressed in sterile gown and gloves (with eye protection and hair net), this is the order:


### 1) Evaluate the patient's anatomy 

Evaluate the patient's anatomy for placement...internal jugular, subclavian or femoral. (there are indications for each location and each has its own risks). 


When I was training, ultrasound was not found everywhere and practicing physicians were not necessarily adept in using it, so I learned by manual palpation and visual inspection where these veins were located, where the skin entry site should be and what structures might lie between the skin and the major vein that was the target of line placement (cannulation... placing a catheter inside a vein).

### 2) Use a finder needle on a syringe with suction to locate the vein.


Ok this one is kind of weird to explain.   In this step you get inside the vein with a finder needle.  This needle is kind of large, so you need to numb up the skin first.  When entering a vein, you want to enter it at an angle that goes with the flow of blood, not at 90 degrees, and not facing "backwards".    Basically aiming in the direction of the heart.  So a jugular cannulation will be directed towards the feet, but a femoral cannulation will be directed towards the head.  


The needle needs to be attached to a syringe large enough to hold with one hand, and still manipulate the plunger with the same hand.   The other hand is typically touching the patient giving you a guide to the landmarks you have already found.  OR holding the ultrasound probe.  


Once the skin is pierced, the needle tip, which is of course hollow, is under the skin.  Now you gently apply some pressure to the plunger by pulling it back and creating a little suction.  Too much and you will suck up fat cells into the needle blocking it. but too little and you won't know when you've hit the vein.   The resistance provided by the tissues is much higher than the resistance provided by blood. SO when the needle enters the vein, there is a sudden release, the plunger pulls further back, and the syringe fills with blood.


This is how you know you're in.


### 3) feed a long sterile wire into the hollow bore needle.


OK, this is the fun / tricky part.  You have a fat needle inside the patient's jugular vein.  You prove it by pulling back on the plunger and seeing dark blood filling the syringe.   Push most of the blood back in, ok? (it's still sterile).  


Now we need to somehow get the actual plastic antibacterial coated catheter into the vein in place of the needle.   The bore of the needle is large enough to allow a wire to be threaded through. The tip of the wire is curled so it won't poke through the vessel wall.  You have to gently uncurl the tip while holding the wire in one hand and the finder needle in the other hand.  Never let go of either until the wire is in! (then still don't let go of the wire).


but the syringe is still attached.    This is where the 'slightly rushed' part comes in.  When you take the syringe off, blood will start to freely flow from the needle inside the vein.  Slowly, and it should be very dark blood.  In some patients who are very very sick there is almost no blood flow.   This is not the moment for the patient to sneeze or cough or else air can be sucked in. 


In one smooth move, the curled tip of the wire is placed in the bore of the finder needle, and a slight twist of the wire hand uncurls it and it will slide right through the needle into the vein.   Sometimes this part does not go smoothly but lets say it does.   Feed the wire up to a certain depth (it has markings, and the depth depends on where you're placing it.  It needs to go near the heart but not inside the heart.


NEVER LET GO OF THE WIRE!


### 4) Remove the needle from the patient
Now you need to get the needle out of the patient.  Since you've created a hole through the skin directly into a large vein, removing the needle can allow blood to leak out around the wire.  I like to press a few sterile 4x4s tightly against the skin entry point, while gently backing the needle out in the direction it went in.  Don't let go of the wire. (You basically need three hands for this, but you're usually the only sterile one).   You're responsible for not losing the wire...one of the risks of this procedure is the wire completely entering the vein, and then they have to go to the OR to get it removed (by what magic I don't even know! Usually interventional radiology can snag it).


So, hold pressure, with one hand, hold the wire with one hand, pull the needle out with one hand (you get good at having one hand to multiple tasks, pinky and ring finger holding the wire against the pinky side of the palm, while index and middle finger pull the needle out.


The other hand is both holding pressure on the entry site while also gripping the needle tip as it is withdrawn to keep from wiggling and lacerating things on the way out.


### 5) Sing some steely Dan (Stevie Nicks anyone?) Make a nick in the skin to create room for the actual catheter to go in.


OK now we have a long wire in the vein.  We need to get a hollow catheter into the vein instead.   Make a little nick in the skin, blade facing away from the wire.  Place the tip of the scalpel in the wire and just push in 1-2mm.  This creates a slightly larger incision in the skin, just enough to allow the soft tip of the catheter to slide in without causing damage to the tip.


### 6) Feed the catheter over the wire.
In another 3 handed move, hold the  end of the wire that is outside the patient with one hand, and with the other hand, slide the catheter tip over the wire.    Feed the wire backwards all the way through the catheter, until it comes out the end of the catheter that will stay outside the patient.  


Why?


because ultimately that wire needs to come out.  We always need to have control over the tip of the wire so it can be pulled out.  That's why the wire is long it needs to:
-stay inside the vessel as a guide
-guide the catheter directly into the vein
-remain accessible to get pulled out at the end.


### 7) Insert the catheter


Gently push the catheter tip through the skin nick (over the wire) and into the patient up to the predetermined depth that you want. Generally femoral catheters go as far as they go.  But jugular and sub-clavian catheters need to stay out of the heart.  So the distance is estimated or measured and the catheter is pushed to that depth. 




### 8) Remove the wire.
NOW ... take the end of the wire that never left your hands, and gently pull it out while holding the catheter in place.


I think it is self-describing. (god that's not the word I want but that's why my brain came up with)


### 9) Secure the catheter
Like everything, there is skill in suturing the catheter in place.  There is a little tool kit with the catheter kit most of the time, there are specific ways to tie the knots so that they don't crimp the catheter, and hold the cather IN, rather than allowing it to willing out, keep the skin healthy that's holding the sutures, and make it easy to remove in a few hours or days.


### 10) Test each port.  Each port has its own little cap (You had to remove the caps as part of the set up).   Some people fill the caps with saline and some don't initially, but when you're done, the entire port needs to be filled with saline, and not blood or air. Blood can clot.  Air can cause problems.


Test and fill each catheter with saline by attaching a slain filled syringe with a lure lock, withdrawing to make sure blood enters the catheter, and then fill with saline.


Each port should flow smoothly. 


Replace the caps and  you're nearly done.


Usually at this point, the critical care nurse will start to clean and prep the surrounding skin to keep the catheter site sterile and the skin healthy. But usually it's best if they can wait until you...


### 11) Find your sharps
It's the operators responsibility to make sure every sharp is found and disposed of.  Sometimes a nurse or assistant will want to help, but if someone moves something from my field and I don't see it later I'm not 100% convinced all the sharps are accounted for.  I usually place my used sharps in the plastic tray.  


Shapes include needles, hollow and solid, scalpels, suture needles.


### 12) Dispose of the rest and ungown
This is satisfying. Once all the sharps are gone, you can fold up the sterile wraps that the kit came in like a gift wrap, bundle it all up and drop it in the biohazard disposal.  When still holding the lid open with your foot (using the foot lever), remove your gown (which will unroll the glove cuff), remove your cuffs the way you learned as a 3rd year medical student on surgery rotation, toss it all in the bin, and you're done!




### 13) Wrap it all up
Scrub up again, thank your staff.


For the awake patients, tell the patient it all went well and they did great.   Tell them they're going to get the medicine they need to feel better.  For the patients who are not awake, check their vital signs so you know all is well (a nurse or anesthetist has been watching them the whole time as well).


write new orders and move to your next patient or procedure.
