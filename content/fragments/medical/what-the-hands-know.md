One of the most sacred parts of training to become a physician is learning how to perform procedures on people.   Whether minor, cosmetic, diagnostic or life-saving, it is a huge privilege to be trusted and trained to do so. 

One procedure stands out where it goes most smoothly when 'slightly' rushed.   By slightly rushed, I don't mean sloppy.  I mean a sequence of physical steps combined with a rapid visual and intuitive assessment of what's happening inside the patient's body during the process. 

we first learn by studying the components and tools that will be used during the procedure, usually a sterile, but opened unused kit, set out specifically for physicians to hold, handle, explore and play with to become accostomed to holding them, manipulating them and the sequence of how to use them. 


Take a central line for example.   There are several steps that must happen in order. 

After determning that a central line is needed, the patient is prepped, and you are scrubbed and dressed in sterile gown and gloves (with eye protection and hair net), this is the order: 

1) Evaluate the patient's anatomy for placement...internal jugular, subclavian or femoral. (there are indications for each locaion and each has it's own risks).  

When I was training, ultrasound was not found everywhere and practicing phsycians were not necessarily adept in using it, so I learned by manual palpation and visual inspection where these veins were located, where the skin entry site should be and what structures might lie between the skin and the major vein that was the target of line placement (cannulation... placing a catheter inside a vein). 

2) Use a finder needle on a syringe with suction to locate the vein. 

Ok this one is kind of weird to explain.   IN this step you get inside the vein with a emporarion needle.  This needle is kind of large, so you need to numb up the skin first.  When entering a vein, you want to enter it at an angle that goes with the flow of blood, not at 90 degrees, and not facing "backwards".    Basically aiming in the direction of the heart.  So a jugular cannulation will be directed towards the feet, but a femoral cannulation will be directed towards the head.   

The needle needs to be attached to a syrninge large enough to hold with one hand, and still manipuliate the plunger with the same hand.   The other hand is typically touchign teh pateint giving youa guide to the landmarkes you ahve already found.  OR holding the ultrasound probe.   

Once hte skin is piereced, the needle tip, which is of course hllow, is under the skin.  Now you gently apply some pressure to the plunger by pulling ot back and creatign a little suction.  Too much and you will suck up fat cells into the needle blockign it. but too little nad you won't know when you've hit the vein.   The resistance privided by the tissues is much higher than the resistacne provided by blood. SO when th eneedle enters the vein, there is a sudden reliease, the plunger pullls further back, and teh syringe fills with blood. 

Thiis is how you know you're in. 

3). feed a long sterile wire into the hollow bore needle. 

OK, this is the fun / tricky part.  You have a fat needle inside the pateitns jugular vein.  You prove it by pulling back on the plunger and seeing dark blood filling the syringe.   Push most of the blood back in, ok? (it's sterile still).   

Now we need to somehow get the actual plastic antibacterial coated catheter into the vein in place of the needle.   The bore of teh needle is large enough to allow a wire to be threaded through. The tip of teh wire is curled so it won't poke through the vessle wall.  You have to gently uncurl the tip while holding the wire in one hand and the finder needle in the other hand.  Never let go of either until the wire is in! (then still don't let go of teh wire). 

but hte syringle is still attached.    This is where the 'slightly rushed' part comes in.  When you take the syrnge off, blood will start to freely flow from the needle inside the vein.  Slowly, and it should be very dark blood.  In some patients who are very very sick there is almost no blood flow.   This is not the moment for the patient to sneezie or cough or else air cna be sucked in.  

In one smooth move, the curled tip of the wire is placed in the bore of teh finder needle, and a slight twist of the wire hand uncurls it and it will slide right through the needle into the vein.   Sometimes this part does not go smoothly but lets say it does.   Feeld the wire up to a certain depth (it has markings, and the depth depends on where youre placing it.  It needs to go near the heart but not inside the heart. 

NEVER LET GO OF THE WIRE! 

4) Remove the needle from the patient
Now you need to get the needle out of the patient.  Since youv'e created ahole through the skin directly into a large vein, removing the needle can allow blood to leak out around the wire.  I like to press a few steril 4x4s tightlyu agaiinst the skin entry point, while gently backing teh needle out in the directly it went in.  Don't let go of the wire. (You basically need three hands for this, but you're usually the only sterile one).   Youre responsible for not losign teh wire...oen of teh risks of this procedure is the wire completely entering the vein, and then they have to go to the OR to get it removed (by what magic I don't even know! Usually interventional readiology can snag it). 

So, hold pressure, with one hand, hold the wire with one hand, pull the needle out with one hand (you get good at having one hand to multiple tasks, pinky and ring figer hlding the wire against the pinky side of the palm, while index and middle finger pull the needle out. 

The other hand is both holding pressure on the entry site while also gripping the needle tip as it is withdraw to keepint from wiggling and lacerating things on the way out. 

5) Sing some steely Dan (Stevie Nicks anyone?) Make a nick in the skin to create room for the actual catheter to go in. 

OK now we hvae a long wire in the vein.  We need to get a hollow catheter into the vein instead.   Make a little nick in the skin, blad facing away from teh wire.  Place the tip of teh scalple inthe wire and just push in 1-2mm.  This creates a slightly larger incision in the skin, just enough to allow the soft tip of teh catheter to slide in without causing damage to the tip. 

6) Feed the catheter over the wire. 
In antother 3 handed move, hold the  end of teh wire that is outside the pateint wiht one hand, and with the other hand, slide the catehter tip over the wire.    Feed the wire backwards all the way through teh catheter, until it comes out the end of the catheter that will stay outside the patient.   

Why?

becuase ultintely that wire needs to come out.  We always need to have control over the tip of teh wire so it can be pulled out.  That's why the wire is long it needs to: 
-stay inside the vessel as a guide
-guide the catheter directly into teh vein 
-remain accessible to get pulled out at the end. 

7) Insret the catheer. 

Gently push the catheter tip through the skin nick (over the wire) and into the patient up to the predetermined depth that you want. Gnerally femoral catheters go go as far as they go.  But jugular and sub-clavian catehters need to stay out of the heart.  So the distance is estimated or measured and the catehter is pushed to th atdepth.  


8) Remove the wire. 
NOW ... take the end of teh wire that never left you rhands, and gently pull it out while holding the cathter in place. 

I think its is self-describing. (god that's not the word I want but that's why my brain came up with) 

9) Secure the cathter
Like everhthign, there is skill in suturing the catehter in place.  There is a little tool kit with the catheter kit most of the time, there are specific ways to tie the knots so that they don't crimp the catheter, and hld the cather IN, riather than allowing it to willing out, keep the skin ehalth that's holding the sutures, and make it easy to remove in a few hours or days. 

10) Test each port.  Each port has it's own likttle cap (You had to remove the caps as part of the set up).   Some oeple fill the caps with saline and some don't initialy, but when you're done, the entire port needs to be filled with saline, and not blood or air. blood can clot.  Air can cause problems. 

Test and fill each catheter with saline by attaching a slain filled syringe with a lure lck, withdrawing to make sure blodo enters the catheter, and then fill with saline. 

Each port should flow smoothly.  

Replace the caps and  you're nearly done. 

USually at this point, the critical care nurse will start to clean and prep the surrounding skin to keep the catehter site sterile and the skin healthy. But usually it's best if they can wait until you...

10) Find your sharps
It's hte operators responsibility to make sure every sharp is foudn and disposed of.  Sometimes a nurse or assistant will want to help, but if some one moves something from my field and I don't see it later I'm not 100% convicned all the sharps are accounted for.  I usualy place my used sharps in the plastic tray.   

Shaprs include needles, holliw and solid, scalpels, suture needles. 

11) Dispose of the rest and ungown
This is satisfying. once all the sharps are goine, you can fold up the sterile wraps that the kit chame in like a gift wrap, bundle it all up and drop it in the biohazard disposal.  When still holding the lid open with your foot (using the foot lever), remove your gown (which will unroll the glve cuff), remove yoru cuffs the way you learned as a 3rd year medical student on surgery rotation, toss it all in the bin, and you're done! 


12) Wrap it all up
Scrub up again, thank your staff. 

For the awake patietns, tell the patient it all wen twel and they did great.   Tel lthem they're goign to get the medicine they need to feel better.  For the patients who are not awake, check their vital signs so you know all is well (a nurse or anesthetist has been watching them the whole time as well). 

write new orders and move to your next patient or procedure.
