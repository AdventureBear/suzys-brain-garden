This is an example coaching post. The **folder structure** (coaching/) is just for your organization - readers won't see it!

## How to use this:

1. **Replace this content** with your actual coaching thoughts
2. **Update the frontmatter** (title, date, tags)
3. **Keep or change the folder** - it's just for your organization
4. **Add tags** that make sense for cross-referencing

## About Tags

Tags let you connect posts across folders. For example:
- A post in `/medical/` could have tags: `[medical, coaching, wellness]`
- A post in `/thoughts/` could have tags: `[personal, coaching]`

Readers can then find all "coaching" posts regardless of which folder they're in!

## About the Folder

Feel free to:
- Move this file to a different folder
- Rename the folders
- Create new folders
- Delete folders you don't use

The folders are **purely for your comfort** while organizing content.
