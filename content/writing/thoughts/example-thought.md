This is a space for your random thoughts, reflections, and musings that don't fit neatly into other categories.

## What goes here:

- Personal reflections
- Life observations
- Stories and memories (like your grandfather stories!)
- Ideas and wonderings
- Anything that doesn't fit elsewhere

## The Beauty of Tags

Even "random" thoughts can connect to themes:
- A memory about your grandfather → `[personal, inspiration, learning]`
- A reflection on creativity → `[creativity, growth, personal]`
- An observation about life → `[philosophy, wellness, reflection]`

## Remember

The `/thoughts/` folder is just organizational - you could put this content anywhere! What matters are the tags that help readers (and you) discover connections between ideas.
