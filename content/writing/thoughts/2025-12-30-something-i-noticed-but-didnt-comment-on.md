## Like a Skip on a Record

My therapist recently got rid of her old upholstered sofa and replaced it with a two-seater couch that feels more like a bench.  It's firmer than the old one, and there's little cushion in the back.  the arms are thin rails with faux leatherette covering and thin padding, so that there's only one specific way you could possibly rest your arm there.  Leaning on it in a reflection pose is out of the question.  

It's a little bit higher than the prior sofa, or maybe the lack of soft cushions means that I sit just the tiniest bit higher. it's enough that I'm unable to rest my feet flat on the ground without a little strain in my low back.   It's not uncomfortable if it were a place you were sitting for a meal or a lecture, but for a setting where the whole point is to enter or at least arrive at an place without my defensive guards up, it's enough to throw up a barrier to that familiar process of arriving, and sitting down, grabbing a pillow for my back, settling in and getting started. 

It requires a little extra presense to remain in a comfortable position using a little more energy, since I can't just cmpletely relax physically.   Like a pair of socks that's slighty too tight, a bra strap that won't sit right or freshly laundered sheets that are just a little but ... scratchy. 

It's all very subtle though and I mostly don't notice it until I reach a point of discomfort in the session...which is the whole reason I'm there.  Then suddenly i'm aware of these distractions preventing me from going fully into an alpha brainwave state, lowering my conscious defenses and letting those slightly repressed inner voices that have been waiting to speak up from coming through. 

It's like a skip on a record that you get used to, a spot on your brakes that pulses when youre slowing down at exactly 23 mph, or needing to use the restroom but ignoring the inner signal just to shave a minute or two from getting to the next thing you need to do. 

Last week I walked in and must have had some expression that she recognized immediately.  There is a gap between the right arm rest and the lace doily covered table in the corner of the room with the soft lamp and ticking clock with the big hand and little hand.   it's a space taht feels small enough that the table is there to be used, but big enough that you might fall into if you let go too much. Or at least big enough that you're keys might fall off the table since it's a bigger reach than it should be.  

All of this went unsaid when she stood up, and kindly, gently said, *"Let's move it closer to the table"*.
