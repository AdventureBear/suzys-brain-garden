When: April 1, 2013  
Where: Kailua-Kona, Hawaii  
Who: Celeste and myself  
What:  Open water swimming  
Why:  End of camp open water swim before flying home.


We entered the water at dig-me beach, and swam past past the end of the Kona Pier.  A string of white pencil buoys stretched into the distance parallel to the rocky shoreline, gradually getting further and further apart.  Our goal ws the first major bouy 0.6 miles from shore, named King's Bouy.   There and back is 1.2 miles.   From there the next bouy is a full kilometer away and markes the turnaround for the Kona Ironman World Championship swim of 2.4 miles.     

My coaching partner Celeste and I had just finished a week long swim camp and it was just the two of us today, no students, no kayaks, no teaching. Nothing but me, she, the blue-green sea, and the fish-balls swimming below us in the crystal clear cold waters. 


Once you clear the end of the dock, the sea floor drops somewhat quickly to about 50 feet deep.  The water is crystal clear and the bottom *almost* looks like you can reach down and touch it.   There is a broad sandy area with no volcanic rock jutting through, where trails of conch snails crisscross one another, an occasional sea-turtle or spotted ray will glide through.  But otherwise that one section seems sea-creature sparse. 


Except for the fish balls.    Fish balls are large crews of small fish that swim in a giant sphere to protect themselves from larger predators.  Some of the predators may only be fish slightly larger than they are.  When one swims into the fish ball, the ball splits in half like a flock of sparrows in the sky, then reforms 10-15-20 feet away from where it split. 


Because the water was so clear here, and the sand so bright, swimming over a fishball was preceded by an abrupt darkening of the  water just in front of you so that you perceived the mass of fish obscuring the white sand before you realized what it was.   Even though the fish balls were probably 20-30 feet below me, for some reason I was always suddenly fearful of swimming over them.  


I never saw a large predator near them but they say that the fish form the balls only when danger is nearby.  


On that day, I had no students to distract my attention from the fish ball, and Celeste, who was fitter and faster than me was 50-100 meters ahead of me... too far for me to get a sense of protection from swimming side by side with another person.


I just kept swimming, watching the sea below me and soon enough the water deepened again and the volcanic floor re-appeared like a submersed mountain top peeking above the white show.


I was enjoying the physical process of swimming without stopping to teach, and also the sensory experience of not following a black line in a pool and not having anyone terribly close that I had to worry about swimming into. 


There were others enjoying the ocean that day but the fishing and diving boats didn't usually get as close to shore as we were.


The swim course from the beach to the King's buoy was maybe 200 yards from the shore but one away from dig-me beach, the shore quickly became volcanic...there were no easy exit points.  Once you started swimming, the only safe option was to return to dig-me beach for the exit.


The saltwater made me super buoyant and I didn't have to exert any energy to stop and rest, laying on my back or stomach and just floating.   It was a wonderful way to end the week. 


A hundred yards or so before arriving at the turnaround where Celeste was waiting, I started to hear a sharp, shrill noise under the water.   It had a high pitched tone, repeated, unmistakeable for a man-made sound.   (How I wished it would have been a whale!).    I stopped for a moment and could hear it above the water as well.  It was everywhere, It wasn't coming from a boat or from a radio on the beach. It was an all encompassing piercing sound that was almost as loud with my head in the water. 


I swam to Ceelest, my heart beating faster than it had been and my mind started to race.   Was this the Tsunami alarm?   I think it is the Tsunami alarm!   I thought of the tragedy in Bali on Christmas day several years ago.   The fatal tsunami wave approached so quickly that many on land did not have time to get away.  


Was there a wave approaching us?  As I swam I kept looking at the fishing boats that were out on the water.  They were still headed out, and not in.   They didn't appear to be alarmed, but they were too far away to communicate with.  I breathed the other direction and looked to the shore for any sign of panic...nothing.


I was starting to think I should turn around and get back to the beach, but Celeste was still ahead of me.    She stopped and I finally caught up. 


> "Is that the tsunami alarm?"


> "I think it is"


> "Should we go back?"


> "I think we should"


> "Why isn't anyone else seeming to head back in?"


> "Dunno.  Ready?"


We headed back, this time with urgency.   Celeste was faster than me and she was swimming quickly.  I used every fiber of fast twitch muscle to keep up with her.  I'd never swim that fast or hard in open water for that long.


I envisioned us being in the ocean when the tsunami arrived. Would we die? Were we safer in the water?


I recalled that in Bali, there were divers underwater that had no idea what had happened when they surfaced.  The sea had destroyed the homes on the shore, but they barely felt any waves when they were submerged.


I kept my wits, but was still slightly panicked.   We swam nearly side by side. I drafted at her hip.  new body sensations surfaced that i'd never felt before. 


I felt like a paper doll as weird as that sounds.  You know how you fold up paper like an accordion, cut out a doll shape and leave the hands and feet connected on the edges. When you open up the paper, you have a row of paper dolls with alternating symmetry.


My swim stroke felt exactly like that: Right side- left side-right side -left side.   I didn't think about my form, I just thought about switching sides as swiftly and cleanly as. I could, not to lose any efficiency and slow down, but to keep up with celeste and not go into oxygen debt.


How my mind went there from dying in a tsunami was a testament to learning and training with Terry Laughlin.  Every moment was an opportunity to learn something about your swimming, feel new body sensations and devise your own experiments to see what worked for you, didn't slow you down and didn't contribute to pain or injury.


So that was my experiment.  If I just think about that symmetric paper doll alternating right left right left without changing my form, would I get to shore before the tsunami arrived?


We got to shore and as we got out of the water, expecting to see people rushing around, bringing boats up higher, or leaving the shore area, we noticed...none of that.  


The tiki boys who rent kayaks and snorkel gear were still open.  We walked over.  

> "What was that noise, was that the tsunami alarm?"

> "Yes the smiled"

> "Is there a tsunami coming?"

> "Yeah it will be here in about 20 minutes".

They kept smiling.   Then giggling.  Then laughing.

Finally they confessed...


> "No, that was the monthly tsunami alarm test, they do it on the first of every month".


So I learned two things that day.   The first is that the tsunami test is on the first of every month, and that swimming like a paper doll might save your life someday.
