When: April 1, 2013

Where: Kailua-Kona, Hawaii

Who: Celeste and myself

What:  Open water swimming

Why:  End of camp open water swim before flying home. 

I swam in the bay at dig-me beach, past the end of teh dock and followed the buoy line.. and my coaching partner Celeste... towards the Kings Buoy that marked the 1 mile turnaround point.   Celeste was fitter and faster than me so I trailed her by 50 meters or more, just enjoying the swim. 

We had just finished a week long swim camp and it was just the two of us today, no students, no kayaks, no teaching. Nothing but me, she, the blue-green sea, and the fish-balls swimming below us in the crystal clear cold waters.  

Once you clear the end of the dock, the sea floor drops somewhat quickly to about 50 feet deep.  The water is crystal clear and the bottom *almost* looks like you can reach down and touch it.   There is a broad sandy area with no volcanic rock jutting through, where trials of conch snails criss cross one another, an occasional ray will glide through, and otherwise that one section seems sea-creature sparse.  

Except for the fish balls.    Fish balls are large crews of small fish that swim in a giant sphere to protect themselves from larger predators.  Some of the predators may only be fish slightly large than they are.  When one swims into the fish ball, the ball splits in half like a flock of sparrows in the sky, then reforms 10-15-20 feet away from where it split.  

Because the water was so clear here, and the sand so bright, swimming over a fishball was preceded by an abrupt darkening of the  water just in front if you so taht you perceived the mass of fish obscuring the white sand before you realized what it was.   Even though the fish balls were probably 20-30 feet below me, for some reason I was always suddenly fearful of swimming over them.   

I never saw a large predator near them but they say that the fish form the balls only when danger is nearby.   

On that day, i had no students to distract my attention from the fish ball, and Celeste was too far ahead of me to get a sense of protection from swimming with another person. 

I just kept swimming, watching the sea below me and soon enough the water depeend again adn teh volcanic floor re-appared like a submersed mountain top peeking above the white show. 

I was enjoying the physical process of swimming without stopping to teach, and also the sensory experience of not following a black line in a pool and not having anyone terribly close that I had to wrry about swimming into.  

There were others enjoyign the ocean that day but the fishing and diving boats didn[t usually get as close to shore as we were. 

The swim course from the beach to the King's bouy was maybe 200 yards from the shre but one away from dig-me beach, the shore quickly became volcanic...there were no easy exit points.  Once you started swimming, the only safe option was to return to dig-me beach for the exit. 

The saltwater made me super bouyant and i didn't have to exert any engery to stop and rest, laying on my back or stomach and just floating.   It was a wonderful way to end the week.  

A hundred yards or so before arriving at the turnaround where Celeste was waiting, I started to hear a sharp, shrill noise under the water.   it had a high pitched tone, repeated, unmistakeable for a man-made sound.   (How I wished it would have been a whale!).    I stopped for a moment and could hear it above the water as well.  it was everywhere, It wasn't coming from a boat or from a radio on the beach. It was an all encompassing piercing sound that was almost as loud with my head in the water.  

I swam to Ceelest, my heart beating faster than it had been and my mind started to race.   Was this the Tsunami alarm?   I think it is the Tsunami alarm!   I thought oof the tragedy in Bali on Christmas day several years before.   The fatal tsunami wave appraoched so quickly that many on land di dnot have time to get away.   

Was there a wave approaching us?  As I swam I kept looing at the the fishing boats that were out on the water.  They were still headed out, and not in.   They didn't appear to be alarmed, but they were too far away to communicate with.  I breathed the other direction and looked to the shore for any sign of panic...nothing. 

I was starting to think I should turn around and get back to the beach, but Celeste was still ahead of me.    She stopped and I finally caught up.  

"Is that the tsunami alarm?" 

"I think it is" 

"Should we go back?"

"I think we should" 

"Why isn't anyone else seeming to head back in?" 

"Dunno.  Ready?" 

We headed back, this time with urgency.   Celeste was faster than me and she was swimming quickly.  I used every fiber of fast twitch muscle to keep up with her.  I'd never swim that fast or hard in oepn water for that long. 

I envisioned us being in the ocean when the tsunami arrived. Would we die? Were we safer in the water? 

I recalled that in Bali, there were divers undewrater that had no idea what had happened when the surfaced.  The sea had destroyed the homes on the shore, but they barely felt any waves when the were submerged. 

I kept my wits, but was still slightly panicked.   We swam nearly side by side. I drafted at her hip.  new body sensations surfaced that i'd never felt before.  

I felt like a paper doll as wierd as that sounds.  You know how you fold up paper like an accordian, cut out a doall shape and leave the hands and feet connected on the edgies. When you open up the paper, you hav a row of paper dolls wiht alternating symmetry. 

My swim stroke felt exactly like that Right side- left side-right side -left side.   I didn't think about my form I jst thougth about siwtching sides as swiftly and cleanly as. I could, not to lose any efficency and slow down, but to keep up with celeste and not go into oxygen debt. 

How my mind went there from dying ina. tsunami was a testament to learning and training with Terry Laughlin.  Efvery moment was an opportunity to learn something about your swimming, feel new body sensations and devise your own experiments to see what worked for you, didn[t slow you down and didn[t contribute to pain or injury. 

So that was my experiment.  If I just think about htat symmetric paper doll alternating right left right lef tiwhout changing my form, would I get to shore before the tsunami arrived? 

We got to shore and as we got out of the water, expecting to see people rushing around, bringing boats up higher, or leaving the shore area, we noticed...none of that.   

The tiki boys who rent kayaks and snorkel gear were still open.  We walked over, and asked. "What was that noise, was that the tsunami alarm?" 

"Yes the smiled" 

"Is there a tsunami cominng?" 

"Yeah it will be here in about 20 mintues". 

They kept smiling.   Then giggling.  Then laughing. 

Finally they confessed...


" NO that was the monthly tsunami alarm test, they do it on the first of every month". 

So I learned two things that day.   The first ist he monthly test, and that swimming like a paper doll might save your life someday.
