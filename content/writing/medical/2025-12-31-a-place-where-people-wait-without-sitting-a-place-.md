## Where I waited without sitting 

Looking back, it's like watching a tv show that I watched a long time ago.  One of those short series shows on netflix or showtime....the kind where every episode ends with a twist and a cliffhanger to keep you waiting on the edge of your seat until the next one. 

But with netflix, you can binge a whole series in one night, no waiting for the next episode needed.  But in real life you have to wait - you have to go through the process of waiting, regardless of the outcome or whether you're still invested in the plot. 

This day I'm remembering was in the "family surgical waiting room" of the hospital where Michael was having his brain surgery. The nearly uncountable unknowns at that time kept me on edge and unable to focus or form coherent thoughts.  Sitting was nearly impossible. How does one sit still when you have no idea if they will come out of brain surgery with the same abilities as they went in? Without knowing what the tumor is, if it's cancerous (probably or it wouldn't be so big), if it's treatable, what that treatment will mean, how long he'll live afterwards, or if he'll even survive the surgery? 

For the surgeon, it was routine...this is the type of surgery he does all the time.   Brain tumor resections.  Michael's brain tumor occupied a big chunk of the left side of his skull, sitting between the motor and sensory cortex.  He couldn't feel his right side very well, and could only control it if he was looking at it.  He'd stopped driving about 2 weeks before at my insistence, but he didn't argue. 

Anyway... waiting? Yeah the wait was endless.   Knowing what I know now and looking back on that version of me waiting in the surgical waiting room, pacing, trying not to think or dwell, waiting with my dad and step mom, and was there anyone else?  I'm so glad I wasn't alone.  My aunt had gone through a similar thing with my uncle who had a different type of cancer.  She told me what phone games she would play that required little thought and was quick to play. Something similar to scrabble or boggle.  I played it.  I messaged my therapist who was quick to reply with something appropriate that was helpful.   

I was in a river of moving current with no control over how fast it went, what kind of boat we had, where the current was going, no paddles, not even a map.  Just riding with no choices other than to watch the shore that we were quickly floating past, or to close my eyes and pretend we were not moving at all. 

I didn't dare stick my hand in to feel the temprature of the water, or see what else surrounded us waiting until we stopped the crazy ride. 

Interminable waiting, pacing, avoiding, not-dwelling, somehow surfing on a crust of "right now" and not tomorrow or yesterday... eventually I got an update.   It was going well. He was awake and following commands DURING surgery.  

I wanted not-waiting more until finally he was done and they let me see him.  He had an amazing smile on his face. He was so happy he survived the surgery and woke up. (that part wasnt really in doubt, but so many unknowns I was relieved as well).  he could talk, he could smile, he could see, he could think.    But his leg didn't work.   The surgeon thought he might have thrown some tiny clots to that part of his brain right at the end of the surgery.  he said it was all working fine, and they were done resecting and closing up when suddenly his leg didn't move from the knee down.   

Like so many moments during those 2 1/2 years of him dealing with brain cancer...I can't even name the type because it looks so evil to me...I wanted a rewind button.   If only hed woken up and that leg worked, the following 2 1/2 years would have been so much easier for him, for us.    But we didn't now what was to come, we were just happy...I was happy...to be done waiting for that particular episode to end, only for a new cliffhanger to be revealed because of that leg that stopped working.
