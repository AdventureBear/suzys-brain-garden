# Prompt Library for Writing Prompt System

**Source**: Extracted from SAMPLE-PROMPTS.md conversation
**Style**: Attention-first, configuration-based, non-emotional
**Count**: 80+ prompts

## Core Principles

Good prompts for this system should:
- NOT mention emotion, belief, or frame things as broken
- NOT imply growth or disappointment
- NOT start with "I felt" or "I realized"
- Ask to describe a **configuration** (people, space, timing, systems, objects, cause/effect)
- Let meaning emerge naturally from arrangement

1. Something I noticed but didn't comment on
2. A process I know well
3. A moment that lasted longer than it should have
4. A detail that changed how I understood the situation
5. Something that happened exactly once
6. An ordinary task performed under unusual conditions

## Usage Notes

- These are options to browse, not assignments to complete
- Pick one that makes you pause or think "huh"
- Let the prompt dissolve once you start writing
- Stop when energy dips
- No obligation to finish or publish
- If a prompt generates an inverse, follow that instinct
